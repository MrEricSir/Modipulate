    * Welcome to Modipulate. This library is intended for
    manipulation between games and music.

    * Currently, it's built only with Lua interface for
    usage with our Love demos.

    * This library is NOT yet stable. It requires CodeLight
    to compile, is unoptimized, and is missing many desired
    functions.
