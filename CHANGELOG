    second library providing a Lua API.

    compiles and runs on Linux, Mac has not yet
    been tested.
    
    * CodeLite is no longer required, though CMake
    can generate project files for CodeLite and many
    other IDEs.

    * Welcome to Modipulate. This library is intended for
    manipulation between games and music.

    * Currently, it's built only with Lua interface for
    usage with our Love demos.

    * This library is NOT yet stable. It requires CodeLight
    to compile, is unoptimized, and is missing many desired
    functions.
