Modipulate
==========

Modipulate is a library for playing and manipulating music in games and
interactive applications.

It loads tracked music files (MOD, XM, IT, etc.) and can signal your
program when certain music events occur. Conversely, your program can
manipulate the song as it plays -- change tempo, mixing, and so on.
