### 2014-02-25 - libopenmpt 0.2-beta4

 *  [Bug] Makefile: Dependency tracking for the test suite did not work.

### 2014-02-21 - libopenmpt 0.2-beta3

 *  [Change] The test suite is now built by default with Makefile based builds.
    Use `TEST=0` to skip building the tests. `make check` runs the test suite.

 *  [Bug] Crash in MOD and XM loaders on architectures not supporting unaligned
    memory access.
 *  [Bug] MMCMP, PP20 and XPK unpackers should now work on non-x86 hardware and
    implement proper bounds checking.
 *  [Bug] openmpt_module_get_num_samples() returned the wrong value.
 *  [Bug] in_openmpt: DSP plugins did not work properly.
 *  [Bug] in_openmpt/xmp-openmpt: Setting name for stereo separation was
    mis-spelled. This version will revert your stereo separation settings to
    default.
 *  [Bug] Crash when loading some corrupted modules with stereo samples.

 *  Support building on Android NDK.
 *  Avoid clicks in sample loops when using interpolation.
 *  IT filters are now done in integer instead of floating point. This improves
    performances, especially on architectures with no or a slow FPU.

 *  Various XM playback improvements.
 *  Improved and switchable dithering when using 16bit integer API.
